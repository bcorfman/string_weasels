# string_weasels
Python version of Richard Dawkins' Weasel program

I wrote this after reading Dudley Chapman's blog post on [Shakespeare, Evolution, and Weasels](https://theappleandthefinch.com/2016/04/30/shakespeare-evolution-and-weasels/).

My daughter is also learning about genetics in her 7th grade science class, so I thought this might interest her also.
